  talk: "Tests Make Good Architects"
  synopsis:
    "<br />This talk takes a look at the positive impacts that automated tests can have on architecture. <br /> <br />
           Unit testing in PHPUnit or PhpSpec, as well as behavioural testing using tools like Behat, have a noticeable effect on software architecture.<br /> <br />
           Tested (or testable) code is often easier to work with, cleaner, and has architectural advantages.<br /> <br />
           We will take a look at some of the impacts that a good test suite can have on your application’s architecture, and how to let your tests be your architect.'"

  talk: "Developing Symfony applications in 2019"
  synopsis:
    "Symfony has evolved a lot during the last few years. Developing applications from Symfony 3 to Symfony 4 provides a drastically new developer experience. <br /> <br />
    We have added new features, but the most important change is not related to the code... Symfony has a revamped developer experience. <br /> <br />
    Starting a new project with Symfony has been dramatically improved and growing a project is more natural than before. <br /> <br />
    Recent versions of Symfony allow you to stay focus on your own business logic without getting in your way with the framework plumbing. The result is less boilerplate code, more productivity, and a decoupled codebase."

  talk: "Learn By Doing (It Wrong)"
  synopsis:
    "<br />As developers we should always be keen to learn more about the work we do, and how we can do it better.<br />
     One of the best ways to learn is to make mistakes, but this can also be one of the hardest - mistakes can lead to problems for your employers or customers, stress for you and strained relationships with your colleagues.<br />
      So how can we make this learning process better? By sharing it of course! In this talk Mike shares some key (and big) mistakes made over his career so far, drawing out the important learning points, and showing how you can harness mistakes to level up your skills."

  talk: "Bro, you even code? The politics of tool shaming"
  synopsis:
    "<br />We've all heard it: 'What?! You're using X framework/language/tool? You must suck at programming!'<br /> <br />
           We work in an opinionated industry, where it's essential to give and take advice; some good, some bad. In this talk James will delve into what's harmful about shaming, and what's constructive.<br /> <br />
           In James' own words:<br /> <br />
           'I felt compelled to write a talk on the subject of tool shaming about a year into becoming a web developer. I'd entered from an old world of statistics where time stood still and everyone was happy, to a flame pit where self-styled 'brogrammers' would flaunt their weight around, offering 'rock-star' opinions on why you suck and your language sucks.<br /> <br />
           At the end of the day, what we do is hard. There is so much criticism to be had, usually relevant. But when it's not relevant, it's damaging. And it has the capacity to make people leave technology. What I want to do in this talk is show the obvious bad points of doing this through real world examples, but also to direct us at where shaming is appropriate. Collaboration and community is something I'm passionate about as are so many, and individual prejudices aren't cool, and I am to address that.<br /> <br />
           PS. I don't care if you use emacs or vim - can you ship it?'"

  talk: "Preemptive multitasking using coroutines in PHP Swoole"
  synopsis:
    "<br />PHP Swoole enables PHP developers to write high-performance, scalable, concurrent TCP, UDP, Unix socket, HTTP, WebSocket services in PHP programming language.<br /> <br />
           Compared with other async programming frameworks or software such as Nginx, Tornado, Node.js, Swoole has the built-in async, coroutines, multiple threads I/O modules.<br /> <br />
           Preemptive scheduling is the key to building a high performance, low latency, near the real-time system.<br /> <br />
           Compared with other programming languages or frameworks, PHP Swoole is one of the very few supports preemptive multitasking using coroutines.<br /> <br />
           This talk we like to introduce the coroutines in PHP Swoole and the implementation of a multitasking coroutines scheduler in PHP Swoole."

  talk: "How MySQL can boost (or kill) your PHP application"
  synopsis:
    "<br />The database is typically the most critical part of a system. It is responsible for storing data, guaranteeing consistency, and retrieving desired information.<br /> <br />
           And it is very tempting to just hope that this will magically happen, without the need of thinking about what the DBMS needs to do.<br /> <br />
           Unfortunately, in practice, when an application is slow the culprit is the database.<br /> <br />
           This talk is about how to make your MySQL queries fast, how to design proper indexes, hot to trade-off reliability for performance (or the other way around), and how to take advantage of some useful MySQL features."

  talk: "Running your PHP site on AWS Lambda with Bref"
  synopsis:
    "<br />Ever find yourself deploying your PHP app to your EC2 boxes and wondering if you're using your resources wisely? You're almost certainly paying for CPU time you're not using, and scaling PHP applications on AWS can be tricky.<br /> <br />
           Wouldn't it be great to pay only for the resources you actually use, and if your site could scale instantly without needing to configure auto-scaling-groups, alarms, and rules? AWS Lambda gives us these features but only supports a few languages natively.<br /> <br />
           Until now making PHP run on AWS Lambda has required a lot of hacks and workarounds. However, evolving tools such as https://bref.sh have fixed a lot of the pain for you.<br /> <br />
           In this session we'll walk through the steps required to set up a real PHP website running on Lambda, served over HTTPS, and all without launching a single EC2 instance or ELB.<br /> <br />
           Finally we'll look at some of the other possibilities and considerations that are now open to us as PHP engineers in a serverless world."

  synopsis:
    "<br />The web API has been a vital part of the JavaScript ecosystem for quite some time now, giving us AJAX, window timers and more.<br /> <br />
           With the rise of progressive web apps, the web API's functionality is increasing like never before.<br /> <br />
           To compete with native applications, the web API has some fantastic and powerful new features, with some awesome, and scary results.<br /> <br />
           During this talk we will explore some of the newer web API features, how to use them and more importantly, the risks that they pose."

  talk: "Squash Bugs with Static Analysis"
  synopsis:
    "<br />All developers know that bugs are bad and finding them can be difficult. The good news is tools to help us find and prevent bugs are becoming more powerful...<br /> <br />

           Modern static analysis tools (e.g. IDEs like PHPStorm and tools like Psalm, Phan and PHPStan) are far more advanced then their predecessors. They can find a whole range of bugs whilst keeping the false positive rate low.<br /> <br />

           This talk introduces more advanced static analysis. It will show the kinds of bugs that the more advanced static analysis tools can find. We’ll then look how they can be added to your current development work flow. We’ll finally look at how we can write our code in such a way to get the most out of static analysis."

  talk: "Five Tips for Aspiring Tech Team Managers"
  synopsis:
    "<br />Management isn't a topic that developers like to discuss a lot, it simply isn't as exciting as single responsibility or interface segregation. It is though a very important topic as management can make or break a tech project. It is aslo an interesting and worthwhile career path for people to follow; learning to mentor and guide younger developers along with learning about the business, finance and legal side of tech projects. <br /><br />
    Transitioning from developer to manager can be difficult though, in my talk I will offer advice for aspiring managers and developers generally on why they should become managers, what to expect and how to become better at it."

  synopsis:
    "<br />Rich domain models, inspired by imperative objective-oriented approaches, dominate our industry. But lean domain models are a compelling alternative. <br /><br />
    By separating behaviour and state, lean models offer an effective way to represent units of behaviour. This session will explore how to represent a lean domain model using a functional programming paradigm. <br /><br />
    We'll explore how types can be used as a natural way to represent business constraints alongside smart constructors and functional validation. How behaviour can be better composed, and how to keep domain behaviour isolated from application state. <br /><br />"

  talk: "Functional Programming in PHP"
  synopsis:
    "<br />It's becoming increasingly difficult to ignore the term 'Functional Programming' while reading online discussions about programming languages or programming in general. People discussing FP routinely use terms that can be strange and unfamiliar to developers coming from the imperative/OO world.   <br /><br />
    What exactly is Functional Programming? Where does it come from? How does it differ from the programming I know?  <br /><br />
    This talk will try to answer these questions by weaving seemingly unrelated concepts into a (hopefully) coherent story of FP, using PHP as the vehicle of expressing these ideas. The side effect (pun intended) of having a basic grasp of FP will make you a better developer, which will make you a better PHP developer. <br /><br />"

  talk: "Grown-up MongoDB: Schema Design"
  synopsis:
    "<br />Although MongoDB is a non-relational database, it is still very important that you store your data in an optimal way. This presentation make you grow up from just starting with MongoDB, to a seasoned user, by teaching you how to design your data schema according to your application's needs. This requires a different mind set than designing for a relational database. <br /><br />

    Besides schema design techniques, I will also cover how to pick indexes, different types of indexes, and way to find out why queries are potentially not as fast as they could be."

  talk: "Getting started with Test-Driven Laravel"
  synopsis:
    <br />"Amo was recently asked by a developer who is new to the Laravel framework, and the PHP language in general, where they should begin with her first project using the framework. <br /><br />

    'Should I define all of my routes up-front?' <br /><br />

    'How about I start with my views? But then, how will I render them? Maybe I need controllers first?' <br /><br />

    'Perhaps I should figure out which models I'll need and go from there?' <br /><br />

    The conversion reminded Amo of when he first begun adopting test-driven development in projects. It can seem overwhelming at first, especially as there's no simple 'how-to' guide or industry standard methodology to take you through an entire feature's lifecycle. <br />

    Fortunately, Laravel not only makes it easy to get started, but to use a test-driven approach which guides your application's development. <br /><br />

    Test-driven development, or TDD often divides opinions within the PHP community. Some of the common comments I often hear from developers, who have not adopted TDD are, 'My boss would never allow more time for testing', 'It takes too long to write tests', 'It's too difficult to learn how to test'.<br /><br />

    This talk aims to highlight some of the benefits of how TDD with Laravel can drive your application's design, and improve your code, without needing additional time commitment."

  talk: "How I built a commercial side project, on the Tube"
  synopsis:
    "Join Rik Heywood as he will be talking about a side project that he has been working on the last few years, called Team Absence (https://teamabsence.com). It is a PHP 7, Laravel 5.2 project that he has built almost entirely on the tube during his daily commute.

    He will be talking through the process of building this project, which has variously been a playground for him to try out new ideas, a fun way to spend his time, or a way to teach himself about new versions of Laravel before subjecting his team to the change.

    It's only recently turned into an actual serious attempt to ship something, so he also wants to talk about what had to change to make that possible.

    Finally, building something real in 30 minute bursts, in a cramped and noise environment has it's own challenges. He'd love people to walk away at the end of the talk believing that, yes, they can try and build that great idea in the back of their head - it can be done."

  talk: "Shipping Faster With Storyplayer"
  synopsis:
    "In the Autumn of 2015, Stuart took on a project to upgrade a payment system - and to deliver it in time for Christmas. He had to build out the new features for a code base he'd never worked on before, which relied heavily on manual testing, with a team who were new to Zend Framework 2. Oh, and he had to do this whilst the original authors of the gateway continued to work on it too - and their work had priority over his.

    What was the secret ingredient that made this possible? Storyplayer, the open-source functional test tool.

    In this talk, Stuart will tell what he can of this recent war story, and show you how his team shipped faster by using Storyplayer. He'll share with you what worked, what didn't, and how you can ship faster too."

  talk: "Dockerizing your CI/CD pipelines"
  synopsis:
    "This talk is intermediate level and should have a bit of something for everyone whether you’re building a standard pipeline (non-docker) or already have a pipeline and looking to see how docker will make it even stronger.

    I will demonstrate how building pipelines with Docker differs from traditional pipelines, what steps are involved in migrating from traditional pipelines to docker ones. I will share my experiences, tips & tricks, lessons learned on my journey into Docker land."

  talk: "Imposter Syndrome: Am I Faking It?"
  synopsis:
    "Do you feel like you're faking it? like you don't feel good enough to do your job? Feeling like you've blagged your way through your career? Then like me and hundreds of others, you might be suffering from imposter syndrome. During my talk I am going to discuss what imposter syndrome is and how it feels. Then I'm going to talk you through why people suffer from it and how people overcome it.

    This talk is based on both my personal experiences and those of others. By the end of it I hope you can identify if you are suffering from imposter syndrome and also create a team environment that helps to combat the feeling within your team mates."

  talk: "Breaking boundaries with FastCGI"
  synopsis:
    "Efficient and performant applications are fantastic; they keep server load, costs and response times low. We can make our web applications more efficient by removing the repetitive bootstrapping process from the request-response cycle.

    How? I hear you ask!

    By using FastCGI we can keep our application alive between requests and vastly improve their performance. The best news is that if you're using a Request-Response framework (such as Symfony) you can easily do this by integrating a simple bundle."

  talk: "Kubernetes"
  synopsis:
    "During this talk I will give you a guide from a developers perspective of getting code running on Googles container platform Kubernetes. This is a platform we are in progress of migrating to at the Home Office, and this talk will focus on my experiences using it.

    Kubernetes is an open source PaaS platform that you can run internally in your company or run on Google's servers. It's based on Docker, and can manage replication, load balancing and resilience built in.

    I'm going to guide you through getting your code running on it, including how to create your own docker containers and best practices for doing so. I'm then going to show you how to get those containers running on Kubernetes. I'll also show you how to wire multiple containers together, and discuss how to manage resilience.

    This talk is aimed at developers of all skill levels, and doesn't focus on any particular language. DevOps people who are interested in Kubernetes will also get an overview of the platform, and I will touch on issues such as data replication between nodes."
